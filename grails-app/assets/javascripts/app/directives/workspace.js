 * Functionality for making draggable, selectable panels that can be interacted with at a grouped and/or selected level.
 * 
 * A grouping of panels is a layer. A panel can be part of multiple layers. Panels selected by the user form a makeshift layer.
 * 
 * In markup, each layer can be a wrapper div. Changing z position can be as simple as moving them between wrapper divs. z-index may not have to be changed, but rather the div the panel is in.
